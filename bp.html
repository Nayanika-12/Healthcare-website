      <p> Blood pressure is determined both by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries.  <br>The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure. <br>A blood pressure reading is given in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). It has two numbers.</p>

           The risk of both low and high blood pressure normally increases with age due in part to normal changes during aging.

        <br>
        <p class="designs" style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;"> Hypotension is the medical term for low blood pressure (less than 90/60).  In healthy people, low blood pressure without any symptoms is not usually a concern and does not need to be treated. </p>

      <div class="skill-row">

        <h3 style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;font-size:2.0rem;">High blood pressure</h3>
        <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">Most people with high blood pressure have no signs or symptoms, even if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels.
A few people with high blood pressure may have headaches, shortness of breath or nosebleeds, but these signs and symptoms aren't specific and usually don't occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or life-threatening stage.
