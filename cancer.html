      <p> Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. <br>Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn’t.These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue.<br> Some types of cancer do not form a tumor. These include leukemias, most types of lymphoma, and myeloma.</p>

        <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">
           Types of cancer are usually named for the organs or tissues where the cancers form.Cancers also may be described by the type of cell that formed them, such as an epithelial cell or a squamous cell.

        <h3 style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;font-size:2.0rem;" >Carcinoma</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="designs" style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;"> Carcinomas are the most common type of cancer. They are formed by epithelial cells, which are the cells that cover the inside and outside surfaces of the body.Carcinomas usually form solid tumors. </p>

      <div class="skill-row">

        <h3 style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;font-size:2.0rem;">Sarcoma</h3>
        <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">A sarcoma is a rare kind of cancer. Sarcomas are different from the much more common carcinomas because they happen in a different kind of tissue.</p>
         <h3 style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;font-size:2.0rem;">Leukemia</h3>
         <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">
           Cancers that begin in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow are called leukemias. These cancers do not form solid tumors. Instead, large numbers of abnormal white blood cells (leukemia cells and leukemic blast cells) build up in the blood and bone marrow, crowding out normal blood cells.
           </p>
           <h3 style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;font-size:2.0rem;">Lymphoma</h3>
           <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">
             Lymphoma is cancer that begins in lymphocytes (T cells or B cells). These are disease-fighting white blood cells that are part of the immune system. In lymphoma, abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes and lymph vessels, as well as in other organs of the body.
