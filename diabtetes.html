      <p> Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. <br>Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn’t.These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue.<br> Some types of cancer do not form a tumor. These include leukemias, most types of lymphoma, and myeloma.</p>

          Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar.The types of diabetes are as follows:

        <h3 style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;font-size:2.0rem;" >Type-1 diabetes</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="designs" style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;"> Type 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin.Symptoms include excessive excretion of urine (polyuria), thirst (polydipsia), constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes, and fatigue. These symptoms may occur suddenly.

        <h3 style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;font-size:2.0rem;">Type-2 diabetes</h3>
        <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">Type 2 diabetes (formerly called non-insulin-dependent, or adult-onset) results from the body’s ineffective use of insulin. More than 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. This type of diabetes is largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity.</p>

         <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">
           Gestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy
 Women with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and at delivery. These women and possibly their children are also at increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the future.
