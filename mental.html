      <p> Everyone is at some risk of developing a mental health disorder, regardless of age, sex, income, or ethnicity. <br> Social and financial circumstances, adverse childhood experiences, biological factors, and underlying medical conditions can all shape a person’s mental health.<br>Many people with a mental health disorder have more than one condition at a time.</p>

          People with conditions such as anxiety or depressive disorder may benefit from relaxation techniques, which include deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness.Several reasons contribute to mental health disoders like:
          </p>
        <br>
        <h3 style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;font-size:2.0rem;" >Continuous social and economic pressure
</h3>


        <br>
        <p class="designs" style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">Having limited financial means or belonging to a marginalized or persecuted ethnic group can increase the risk of mental health disorders
  </p>

      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">

        <h3 style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;font-size:2.0rem;">Childhood adversity
</h3>
        <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">Several studies support that adverse childhood experiences such as child abuse, parental loss, parental separation, and parental illness significantly affect a growing child’s mental and physical health.</p>
         <h3 style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;font-size:2.0rem;">Biological factors
</h3>
         <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">The NIMH(National Institute of Mental Health) suggests that genetic family history can increase the likelihood of mental health conditions as specific genes and gene variants put a person at higher risk. However, many other factors contribute to the development of these disorders. Having a gene associated with a mental health disorder does not guarantee that a condition will develop. Likewise, people without related genes or a family history of mental illness can still have mental health issues.
